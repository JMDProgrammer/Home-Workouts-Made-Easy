Personal notes so that I do not get lost inside of this project backend stuff

1. using this video:
Introduction - Full Stack Web Development Course [1] | ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, MySQL

1. creating json package file inside of the client server
    dicates the config of your project
    to initialize the server:
        npm init

2.  first package is the express library
    helps create the rest api really easily
    this makes: 
            package-lock.json
            node_modules folder
    command to do this:
    npm install express

3. other things to install inside of the server folder:
    npm install express cors
